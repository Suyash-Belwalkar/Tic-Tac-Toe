To run the application just clone this repository and open in Xcode!
Press run(cmd+R) to run the application.
If using a real device (iPhone or iPad) remember to select the run destination in the toolbar at the top from the dropdown.

The aapp is completely developed in swiftui.
AI was used only to implement one animation(Winner/Draw declaration) else everything else is written by me without the use of AI.
